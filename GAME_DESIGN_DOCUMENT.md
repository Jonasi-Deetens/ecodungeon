# 🌿 EcoDungeon: Multi-Zone Ecosystem RPG

## Complete Game Design Document

---

## 🎯 **CORE VISION**

A **2D top-down dungeon crawler** where each zone is a **living ecosystem** that players must navigate, manage, and survive. Think "Stardew Valley meets Dark Souls" with ecological consequences and dynamic faction relationships.

## 🏗️ **ZONE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Zone Types & Progression**

```
🌱 Zone 1: "Mossy Caverns" (Tutorial)
├── Simple ecosystem: Moss, Rats, Small Spiders
├── 2-3 rooms, basic doors
├── Introduces core mechanics
└── Factions: Moss Farmers (Peaceful), Cave Rats (Hostile)

🌿 Zone 2: "Fungal Forest"
├── Medium complexity: Fungi, Beetles, Venomous Slugs
├── 4-5 rooms, doors + 1 stairway
├── Introduces ecosystem mixing
└── Factions: Fungal Cultivators (Peaceful), Venom Hunters (Hostile)

🕷️ Zone 3: "Spider's Web"
├── Advanced: Giant Spiders, Poisonous Plants, Parasites
├── 6-8 rooms, multiple stairways
├── Ecosystem warfare begins
└── Factions: Web Weavers (Neutral), Parasite Collective (Hostile)

```

### **Zone Properties**

- **Unique Ecosystem**: Each zone has its own creature types, plants, and environmental conditions
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Health, damage, and complexity increase per zone
- **Environmental Hazards**: Poison gas, acid pools, darkness, etc.
- **Resource Distribution**: Different zones have different valuable resources
- **Faction Territories**: Each zone has dominant and minor factions

## 🏛️ **FACTION SYSTEM**

### **Core Faction Types**

```
🟢 **Peaceful Factions**
├── Herbivores (Rats, Rabbits, Deer)
├── Farmers (Beetles, Ants, Bees)
├── Healers (Glow-worms, Medicinal plants)
└── Traders (Merchant creatures, Resource gatherers)

🔴 **Hostile Factions**
├── Predators (Spiders, Wolves, Dragons)
├── Raiders (Goblins, Bandits, Pirates)
├── Corruptors (Dark magic users, Disease spreaders)
└── Territorial (Guard creatures, Zone protectors)

🟡 **Neutral Factions**
├── Scavengers (Vultures, Rats, Opportunists)
├── Observers (Wise creatures, Information brokers)
├── Nomads (Traveling creatures, Zone hoppers)
└── Guardians (Ancient protectors, Balance keepers)
```

### **Faction Dynamics & Relationships**

```
Peaceful ↔ Peaceful: Allies (Share resources, protect each other)
Peaceful ↔ Hostile: Prey/Predator (Natural hunting relationships)
Peaceful ↔ Neutral: Cautious (Trade when beneficial)
Hostile ↔ Hostile: Rivals (Compete for territory and resources)
Hostile ↔ Neutral: Opportunistic (Use neutral factions as tools)
Neutral ↔ Neutral: Independent (Form temporary alliances)
```

### **Dynamic Relationship Changes**

```
🌱 **Environmental Factors**
├── Resource scarcity → Increased hostility
├── Population imbalance → Faction wars
├── Zone corruption → Faction corruption
└── Ecosystem mixing → New faction alliances

⚔️ **Player Actions**
├── Killing peaceful creatures → Peaceful factions become hostile
├── Helping healers → Healers become allies
├── Trading with merchants → Better prices and protection
├── Corrupting zones → Corruptors become friendly
└── Restoring ecosystems → All factions become more friendly

🔄 **Ecosystem Evolution**
├── Species migration → New faction relationships
├── Climate changes → Faction behavior shifts
├── Disease outbreaks → Faction survival struggles
└── Resource discovery → Faction cooperation/conflict
```

### **Zone-Specific Faction Examples**

#### **Zone 1: "Mossy Caverns"**

```

## 🚪 **DOOR & STAIRWAY MECHANICS**

### **Door System**

```
🔓 Open Door: Ecosystems mix, creatures can migrate, factions interact
🔒 Closed Door: Ecosystems remain isolated, factions stay separate
⚡ Powered Door: Requires energy/keys to open, controlled access
🛡️ Reinforced Door: Prevents ecosystem mixing, faction isolation
🔐 Faction Door: Only certain factions can open/close
```

### **Stairway System**

```
⬆️ Up Stairs: Return to previous zone (with ecosystem changes)
⬇️ Down Stairs: Progress to harder zone
🔄 Spiral Stairs: Connect multiple zones
⚡ Teleporter: Instant zone travel (rare)
🌊 Water Stairs: Aquatic zone connections
```

### **Ecosystem Mixing Consequences**

- **Creature Migration**: Stronger creatures invade weaker zones
- **Resource Competition**: Plants compete for space and nutrients
- **Disease Spread**: Parasites and diseases can spread between zones
- **Population Explosions**: Some species thrive in mixed environments
- **Zone Corruption**: Aggressive species can "corrupt" peaceful zones
- **Faction Wars**: Different factions may conflict when zones mix
- **Alliance Formation**: Some factions may ally against common threats
